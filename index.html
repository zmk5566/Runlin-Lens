        I prefer texts over phone calls.6y
        
        Because
        
        When I write/read
        
        I prefer
        
        To send/get
        
        One text message
        
        Instead of
        
        Multiple
        
        Messages.
        
        And
        
        It's better, I meant when
        
        You
        
        Look
        
        At
        
        It.
        
        Writing this alone killed some of my brain cells.
        
        If you're talking about long messages in general, then I don't know.. Maybe people have a lot to say?

        A lot of people write long texts. Freaky? This needs more expansion or clarification. And also, it would help to ask them why. There are some simple answers, some may have nothing better to do, some may feel the need to explain themselves, some may think it an inappropriate time to call with lengthy diatribes or questions, comments. Then again, some people may be this way, and at some point it’s a matter of what you can tolerate. To me it doesn’t matter.

        They haven't had real conversation in long time. Or especially in person. People used talk on the phone for hours. I work the nightshift and it's dead silence almost every night, my coworkers don't really like me. So I end block texting , I get so excited to talk my friends about the crazy stuff that happens that end up texting a letter on a simple response, and usually get ignored before I get to tell them what I actually wanted to…

        Every time I text someone, I write lengthy messages. Does this correlate to overthinking too much? And why do I always end up writing too much when I only wanted to say one simple thing in the first place?

        I kind of get where the question is coming from. I personally think, if you got lots to say, pick up the phone and talk about it. I stand behind the idea that texts were meant for short handed communication. There’s a reason why orinaginally text messages were only 120 characters.
        
        Again: this is just my opinion, you’re entitled to your own.

        Phone texting (and email) are replacing what has been for at least a couple of centuries the letter writing. As these letters (written on paper) were usually laborious and ample (if less frequent than SMSing) it has somehow remained our habit to text lengthier missives instead of telegram like texting. It's a subconscious thing. That's why we tend to write long text messages which is something perfectly benign (there once was such a thing like a billlet amoureux). There's nothing wrong with writing too much unless the person who you write to resents it, case in which it is slightly selfish and… (more)

        Why is it taboo to send long text messages?
        
        I never heard there is taboo thing about sending long text message until I see this question, I dont know if in other place of this world sending long text message becoming an issue.
        
        I like to read long text message either sending one. We can valued the personalities of people by looking how they send a text message through the structure of sentences and word they choose in sending texts.
